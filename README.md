## MPU6050-Motion-and-Collision-detection
MPU6050 interrupt to detect collision and motion


# Motion detection
Motion detection is accomplished by checking change accelerometer positions in the X,Y and Z directions. The threshold can be fine tuned for calibration.
This maybe used in a variety of applications including detection of motion in secure places, initiating alarms, detecting door passes, lightsabers motion, vehicle tracker motion detection and so much more
 

# Collision detection 
The INT pin is configured to go high as a collision is detected. The collision range is set between 1 t0 255 for different  G's.
An interrupt is set for detection of collision as soon as they occur.
This can be applied in applications such as: detection of falling animals/human beings/objects, detection of accidents in motor vehicle, alarm systems, window and door breakage detection for secure houses/offices/warehouses.... could go on.


Give this a star if you find it useful ;)
